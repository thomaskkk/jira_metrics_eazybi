# Cycletime
# Percentiles - Cycletime percentiles that the script should return as columns
Cycletime:
    Percentiles:
        - 50
        - 85
        - 95

# Throughput
# Throughput range - Number in days of historic data that should be used counting from today
# (Ex. 90 = starting from 90 days ago until today)
# This is also the source data that will be used to generate the monte carlo simulations
Throughput_range: 90

# Monte Carlo Simulation
# Simulations - how many simulations we should run, 10k should give you a good result
# Simulation Days - Quantity of days to be added as a parameter of the simulation, result will be how many items will fit this timebox
# Percentiles - that the script should return, the script will return the nearest neighbor result
Montecarlo:
    Simulations: 10000
    Simulation_days: 14
    Percentiles:
        - 50
