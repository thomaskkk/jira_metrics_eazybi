# Custom issuetypes, right now you can't change the 3 types: Story, Bug, Task
Issuetype:
    Story: Hist√≥ria
    Bug: Bug
    Task: Tarefa
# Cycletime
# Percentiles - that the script should return
# NOTE: for now cycletime percentiles and montecarlo percentiles should match
Cycletime:
    Percentiles:
        - 50
        - 85
        - 95

# Simulations - how many simulations we should run 10k should give you a good result
# Source - Which Throughput/day we should use to run the simulation, must be Story, Bug, Task or Throughput (sum of all 3)
# Percentiles - that the script should return, the script will return the nearest neighbor result
# NOTE: for now cycletime percentiles and montecarlo percentiles should match
# Simulation Days - Quantity of days to be added as a parameter of the simulation
Montecarlo:
    Simulations: 10000
    Percentiles:
        - 50
