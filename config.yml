# Custom issuetypes, right now you can't change the 3 types: Story, Bug, Task

# Simulations - how many simulations we should run 10k should give you a good result
# Source - Which Throughput/day we should use to run the simulation, must be Story, Bug, Task or Throughput (sum of all 3)
# Percentiles - that the script should return, the script will return the nearest neighbor result
# NOTE: for now cycletime percentiles and montecarlo percentiles should match
# Simulation Days - Quantity of days to be added as a parameter of the simulation
